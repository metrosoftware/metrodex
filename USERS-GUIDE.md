### MRS (Metro Reference Software) ###

  - client-server application
  - JavaFX UI on supported platforms
  - also access via a Web browser like Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome
  - accounts are accessible from everywhere in the world
  - very strong and long passphrases required

### Metro ###

  - peer-to-peer protocol
  - efficient blockchain technology (can run on low-power devices)
  - allows payment *transactions*, *exchange trading*, *name registrations*, *voting* and much more
  - no need to trust third parties anymore

### Forging (aka block generation) ###

  - reward for securing the network
  - start via the browser interface
  - requires only:
    - decent amount of the base currency MTR
    - running MRS (browser or tab can be closed)
    - very little CPU power

`metro.mine.publicKey=<your public key>`

Add your Metro node address

`metro.mine.serverAddress=<server_address>` . Default value = localhost. Set different if you want to get work from remote node.
